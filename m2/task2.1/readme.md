### PART 1.

1. I know of the most popular hypervisors for virtualization such as:
- Microsoft Hyper-V; 
- VMware vSphere Hypervisor; 
- Oracle VirtualBox;
- Citrix XenServer.

2. Type 1 hypervisor are hypervisors that run directly on the physical hardware of the host machine. 
   Due to the fact, this type of hypervisor is considered the most effective. 
   It is also considered the most efficient for corporate computing.
   
   Type 2 hypervisors differ from the first in that they are usually installed in an existing operating system. 
   This makes it a hosted hypervisor because it uses the host's OS to perform certain operations, 
   such as managing calls to the CPU, managing network resources, and managing memory and storage. 
   This allows Type 2 hypervisors to support a wide variety of hardware.
